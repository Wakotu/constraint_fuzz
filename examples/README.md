# Guide of examples.

To facilitate users' understanding of the functionality and effectiveness of PromptFuzz, we have included a collection of fuzz drivers generated by PromptFuzz as illustrative examples for each library.

These fuzz drivers can be found in the `examples` directory, organized into subdirectories according to the respective library names.

Within each subdirectory, two types of fuzzers are available: `fuzzer_0` and `fuzzer_1`. The fuzz drivers in `fuzzer_0` are the code generated by LLMs. These code snippets have undergone necessary instrumentation but their fuzzing capabilities have not been extended. On the other hand, the fuzz drivers in `fuzzer_1` have been processed to incorporate extended fuzzing capabilities by converting the arguments of library API calls.

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these fuzz drivers, we have also provided the clang coverage profdata `default.profdata` for each fuzzer. To retrieve the coverage information for these fuzz drivers, you can execute the following command:

`llvm-cov report xxx/the_test_lib.so --instr-profile=default.profdata`.
